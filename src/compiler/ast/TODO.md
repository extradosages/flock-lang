# TODO

1. Continue deriving parsers from other parsers in parser bundles.
1. Replace `Empty` data with `Scalar<undefined>`
1. Organize a bit better
1. Shake the tree a bit
1. Make data dimensionality more easily indexable by node kind-- the project structure is a bit busy and the important stuff, like the classes, are hard to find
1. replace `lodash` with `iter-tools`
1. convert to esm
